###Reflective Statement:

Embarking on the journey of implementing the Food Ordering app has been both challenging and rewarding. Throughout the development process, I encountered various tools and technologies, and the experience was a mix of successes and challenges.

Tools and Technologies:
The tools and technologies used in the project, such as Android Studio and Java, provided a robust development environment. However, integrating APIs proved to be a significant challenge. Despite multiple attempts, I faced persistent issues, including crashes on my PC. This became a roadblock, hindering my ability to incorporate real-time data and external services into the app.

Third-Party Code Samples:
In overcoming coding challenges, I relied on third-party code samples from platforms like StackOverflow. These snippets were instrumental in resolving specific issues, such as UI layout problems and RecyclerView implementations. Leveraging generative AI was a novel experience, offering creative solutions to problems, though adapting these outputs to my specific requirements required careful consideration.

Challenges Faced:
The primary challenge revolved around API integration. Despite thorough documentation, my system consistently crashed, preventing me from implementing dynamic features like real-time order tracking. This frustration led me to reconsider my approach and focus on creating a functional app, even if it meant compromising some originally planned functionalities.

Successes:
Despite the challenges, several aspects of the project were successful. The app design, utilizing RecyclerViews and ConstraintLayouts, showcased a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. 
Lessons Learned:
This project served as a learning experience, highlighting the importance of adaptability in the face of challenges. While APIs presented formidable hurdles, the decision to prioritize other functionalities ensured the overall success of the project. The reliance on third-party code samples and generative AI underscored the collaborative nature of software development, emphasizing the importance of leveraging existing knowledge. Only if i could show how many apps i tired other than this for me to work but it just kept on crashing and i just felt defeated.

Future Development:
Looking ahead, I recognize the need for a more thorough understanding of APIs and strategies for mitigating potential system crashes. Future projects will benefit from a proactive approach to troubleshooting, potentially exploring alternative libraries or tools to overcome persistent challenges. Additionally, maintaining a balance between project ambitions and system capabilities will be crucial for a smoother development experience.

In conclusion, the Food Ordering project has been a rollercoaster of challenges and triumphs. Despite initial feelings of being "lost in the sauce," the experience has equipped me with valuable insights and skills that will undoubtedly influence my approach to future development endeavors.
